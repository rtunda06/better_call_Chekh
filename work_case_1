Git is a version control system designed to track changes in project files and facilitate collaboration within a team. The main tasks and commands in Git include:
Repository Initialization: The git init command creates a new Git repository in the current directory or initializes an existing project as a repository.
Commit Creation: The git commit command allows you to save the current state of the project in its history. Each commit includes a message explaining what changes were made.
Adding Files to the Index: The git add command adds changes in files to the "index" (or "staging area"). Files in the index will be included in the next commit.
Checking Status: The git status command displays the current status of files in the working directory, index, and repository.
Branch Switching: The git checkout command allows you to switch between different branches in the repository. Branches enable you to separate the project's history and develop it in parallel.
Synchronization with Remote Repository: The git push and git pull commands are used to interact with remote repositories. git push sends changes to the server, while git pull updates your local repository with changes made by others.
Commit History: The git log command lets you view the commit history of the repository. It displays a list of commits, their hash sums, authors, dates, and messages.
Branching and Merging: Git allows you to create branches for working on specific features or tasks and then merge them into the main branch using the git merge command.
